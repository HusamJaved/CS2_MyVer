            <h1>GAME CHANGER</h1>
            <p>Smoke Grenades are now dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment, and react to lighting, gunfire, and explosions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h5>Gameplay</h5>
            <p>Smoke now has the ability to interact with other gameplay events, creating new opportunities. Bullets and HE grenades can push smoke to briefly clear sightlines or expand occlusion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h5>Expands to fill spaces naturally</h5>
            <p>Now the smoke will seep out of opened doorways and broken windows, go down and up stairs, as well as expand in long corridors and combine with other smokes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h5>Reacts to Lighting</h5>
            <p>In Counter-Strike 2 smoke particles work with the unified lighting system allowing for more realistic light and color.</p>

        <h1>WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET</h1>
        <h6>Tick rate no longer matters for moving, shooting, or throwing.</h6>
        <p>Sub-tick updates are the heart of Counter-Strike 2. Previously, the server only evaluated the world in discrete time intervals (called ticks). Thanks to Counter-Strike 2’s sub-tick update architecture, servers know the exact instant that motion starts, a shot is fired, or a ‘nade is thrown.<br><br>As a result, regardless of tick rate, your moving and shooting will be equally responsive and your grenades will always land the same way.</p>

        <h1>THERE'S MORE TO COME</h1>
        <p>The Limited Test only evaluates a subset of Counter-Strike 2's features, so that major issues can be resolved before the summer. But there’s much more to come. In just a few months we’ll reveal all of the details of Counter-Strike 2, and we can’t wait to share it with you.</p>
